Hi there!

This is a Best fit model for MT_Cars.ipynb file, a Machine Learning project soon to be integrated with Flask. It is to predict the mpg-miles per gallon from the most relavent independent variables that the
mpg(dependent variable relies on. The variables are 'wt'-weight, 'hp'-horse power, 'cyl'-cylinders and 'disp'.

The algorithms used are:
Linear Regression::Ridge Regression
The results are as follows:
Linear Regression:- 74% accurate / error free
Ridge Regression:-78% accurate


The next file named The Best diamond price.ipynb , a ML project soon to be integrated with Django. It is to predict the best price of the diamond based on the cut, clarity, length, carat of the diamond.

The algorithms used are SVM-Support Vector Machine (84% accurate)
An improved model by Random Forest Regressor with 98% accuracy.
