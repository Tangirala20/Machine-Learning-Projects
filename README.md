Hi there!

This is a .ipynb file, a Machine Learning project soon to be integrated with Flask/ Django. It is to predict the mpg-miles per gallon from the most relavent independent variables that the
mpg(dependent variable relies on. The variables are 'wt'-weight, 'hp'-horse power, 'cyl'-cylinders and 'disp'.

The algorithms used are:
Linear Regression::Ridge Regression
The results are as follows:
Linear Regression:- 74% accurate / error free
Ridge Regression:-78% accurate
